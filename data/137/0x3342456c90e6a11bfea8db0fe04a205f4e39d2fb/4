  "description": "このお花を手に入れられる人は誰ひとりもいないの。\nそりゃそうよ。\nなんでかって？\n\n地球じゃない、カラフル隕石のところにいるの。\nそりゃあ誰も来るわけないっしょ。\n\nだって、虹色惑星にいるもの。\n\nそんな来る人なんていないわ。\n他にもいろんな種類のお花があって、お花たちでしゃべっているの。\n\n一人だけこの世界に人間の子がいるの。\n急にタイムスリップしてここに来たらしいの。\nヒラビちゃんっていう名前なの。\n\n最初は地球って星のみんなの知らない場所にいた。\n\nヒラビちゃんは元はユニコーンでもあったの。\nヒラビちゃんに家族はいなかったの。\nなんで名前がわかるのかというと、やさしいおばあさんがいて、家族がいないことを知って名前をつけてくれたの。\n\nヒラビちゃんがお花たちにそう話してくれたの。\n\n人間なのに話せるのは不思議と思っていたら、ヒラビちゃんはユニコーンでもあるし、お花の妖精でもあったの。\n\nこの子は虹色の惑星に最初いた子だったことがわかった。\n\nなぞのおばあちゃんは宇宙にいたけど、\n魔法の扉が出現して地球の日本にワープしてたの。\n\nヒラビちゃんは最初はビビってたけど、どんどん慣れてきたし、\nお絵描きが好きだから、紙にお花たちをかいてくれたりお水をくれたりする。\n\nそれでこのお花たちとその子は1日で仲良くなったの。\n\n元々ユニコーンでもあったヒラビちゃんに、\nお花たちは食べられちゃうんじゃないかと思った。\n\nヒラビちゃんは2才の女の子だったけど\nユニコーンに変身すると5才の脳になるの。\nだからお花を食べないでいられるの。\n\n今ではすっかり仲良し。\nお花の中には人間になれる子もいた。\nひとつのお花が人間になってくれて、ヒラビちゃんと2人で\nお花たちとも仲良く暮らしてます！\n\nおしまい。\n\nこれを買ってくれた人にはヒラビちゃんがつくかもしれないよ😆\n\nNo one can get these flowers.\nThat's right.\nWhy?\n\nWe're not on Earth, we're in a colorful meteorite.\nNo one will come.\n\nBecause we are on a rainbow-colored planet.\n\nNo one would come.\nThere are all kinds of other flowers, and they talk to each other.\n\nThere is only one human child in this world.\nShe suddenly slipped through time and came here.\nHer name is Hirabi-chan.\n\nAt first, she was on a planet called Earth, in a place unknown to everyone.\n\nHirabi-chan used to be a unicorn.\nHirabi-chan had no family.\nHow does she know her name? She had a kind old lady who knew she had no family and gave her a name.\n\nHirabi-chan told this to the flowers.\n\nI wondered why she could talk even though she was human, but it turned out that Hirabi-chan was both a unicorn and a flower fairy.\n\nIt turned out that she was the first child on the rainbow-colored planet.\n\nThe mysterious grandmother was in space.\nBut then a magical portal appeared and she was warped to Japan, Earth.\n\nHirabi-chan was scared at first, but she got used to it.\nShe liked to draw, so she would draw flowers on the paper and give me water.\n\nSo these flowers and the little girl became friends within a day.\n\nHirabi-chan, who was originally also a unicorn, had a very special way of getting to know the flowers.\nI thought the flowers were going to be eaten by Hirabi-chan, who was also a unicorn.\n\nHirabi-chan was a 2 year old girl.\nBut when she transformed into a unicorn, she became a 5 year old brain.\nThat's why she doesn't eat the flowers.\n\nNow they are good friends.\nSome of the flowers became human.\nOne flower became a human and Hirabi-chan and I are both\nWe are living together with the flowers, too!\n\nThe end.\n\nWhoever buys this may get Hirabi-chan 😆.",
