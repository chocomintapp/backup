However, it did not need a college degree for me to understand its momentum and change it will bring to how we use internet. To shape that future into reality I am currently working on developing ,from business side, Hokusai API which is a simple web API solution for NFT services development with the belief that this approach of Web 2.5 would help onboarding people to the world of web 3.0. I would like to develop more ideas of web 2.5 like Hokusai API to get more people joining in this space and therefore I will use the fund to  implement the ideas into products and I also want to distribute the fund to support people to start web 2.5 projects by providing the small initial capital. All the transaction and decision making process will be for everyone to see and any gains, if there are, from it would be all used again to support the ecosystem.   \n\nFor that reasons... I quit college! \n",
