I am imagining a future of a better world that transcends race.\n\n　When you are in virtual space, my art is in the space you like best.\n　When you are in physical space, my art is in the space you love the most.\n　\n　The principle of the universe that transcends race and gender, the crypto code that is the essence of life. \n　“The Crypto of Life\" is a work of art about the world as seen through my eyes in early 2021.\n　\n▶︎ Upsetters®︎ “The Product First” New era origin brand\n　Upsetters®︎ has been selling 45 RPM analog record adapters featuring a crown since 2020. \n　Upsetters®︎ is an original brand based in Tokyo, Japan that presents its work as product art for analog record lovers around the world.\n　It is a contemporary crypto art work of art created by artist JET(Upsetters®︎).\n\n　①.
