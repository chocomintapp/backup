  "description": "A typical sauce cutlet bowl is a bowl of pork cutlet topped with rice and topped with sauce.  In a full-fledged restaurant, instead of sprinkling the sauce from above, the pork cutlet may be soaked in a large amount of sauce for a short time before being put on rice.  Depending on the region, cabbage may be placed under the cutlet.",
