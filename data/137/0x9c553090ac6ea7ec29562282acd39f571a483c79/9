  "description": "\"This is a “Goshuin” of Amida-Nyorai, Buddha of Infinite light. Amida-Nyorai presides over The West Pure Land of Amida Buddha, Paradise of Utmost Bliss. Amida-Nyorai volunteered to practice the ascetic exercises in place of others, making it easier for them to receive same blessing as Amida-Nyorai achieved. All they would have to do is praise his name, and as a result, believers were able to go to The West Pure Land after death.\"",
