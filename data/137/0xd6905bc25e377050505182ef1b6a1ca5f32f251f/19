  "description": "\"Ladies and gentlemen! The racing is about to begin!\"\n\"I believe in you, Elizabeth!\"\n\"Go, Black Buzz, Go!\"\n\"Yuki again!? Give me back my money!\"\nIt was so noisy. The summer night was so hot, and there was no air conditioner.\nBut nothing bothered Yuki at the moment.\nShe only thought about the crown.\nWith the most burning spirit Yuki ever had, she wore a helmet.\n\n'BANG!'\n'VROOOM!'\nMotorbikes ran at the same time.\nLoud motorbike noise rang the city again.\nYuki held the throttle and sped up the motorbike.\n\nSomething was different than before.\nThe motorbike sped up unexpectedly fast.\nYuki's motorbike passed the opponents at a twice faster speed than before.\n'VROOM!'\n6th,5th,4th...\nYuki was running in 3rd place already.\nThen the 1st and 2nd opponents blocked her way.\n\"Elizabeth and Indigo!\"\nThey teamed up when Yuki was chasing them.\nBut Yuki was ready for it.\n'I've been waiting for this moment. The moment that switches the crown! Now is the chance!'\nThere was a U-turn track ahead of them.\n\"Now!\"\n'BANG!'\nShe held the brake.\nYuki's bike got thrown out of the track.\nElizabeth saw her in the back mirror.\nYuki's bike was flying in the air.\nThen it wildly landed on the opposite road. It rotated big and left a circle skid mark.\nElizabeth and Indigo were frustrated. Yuki smiled and passed them.\n\"Yuki! Yuki! Yuki achieves the crown! Can't believe it!\"\nSo this is the sense of achievement, Yuki thought so.\n\"Ms.Mentari registered no insurances. Maybe the surgery will cost quite much.\"\nYuki and the doctor were talking in front of the surgery room.\nThe 1st prize money was not enough for it.\nYuki had the salary that she got from me, but it was the money for AKUMA.\nYuki had a moment of thinking.\n'She lend me her bike, even when she was as poor as me.'\n'She always talked with me about what happened every day, eating cheap noodles.'\n'She went to the garage to fix the bike, just for me.'\nYuki decided.\n\"I'll pay for the surgery.\"\nYuki didn't choose AKUMA.\n\nFor the whole next week, Yuki visited the hospital to meet Mentari.\n\"Yuki, please cut the apple next to you.\"\n\"Shut up, Mentari. Only this time.\"\n\nI somehow finished making all bouquets on that day. I just had a cold the next day.\nMs.hoverfly greeted Yuki.\nThis time, everything went well.\n\n\"Don't you feel sad about the bike?\" \"I do.\" After having lunch, I and Yuki walked toward the shop. \"Mentari has a good friend anyway.\" \"Nah, she will have to pay me forever.\" \"Friends do not owe each other. Let me pay you instead.\" \"What do you mean?\" An AKUMA with a delivery case was parked in front of my shop. \"I'm thinking about flower delivery service, but I don't have a driver's license. You know what I mean?\" I saw Yuki's face. It was an embarrassing, surprising, and pleasing face at the same time.",
