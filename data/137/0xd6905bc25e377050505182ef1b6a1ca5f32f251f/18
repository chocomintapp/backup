  "description": "\"Yuki! Can you make a bouquet for this ma'am?\" \"On my way!\" Yuki adjusted to the job faster than I thought. Splitting the pot, making a bouquet, and facing customers, she was getting used to them. \"Here it is, Ma'am.\" \"Thank you! It's really pretty.\" Soon I realized that Yuki is a genius at flowers. \"See you later!\" Yuki got the confidence. Maybe it was because she finally found what she is good at. Yuki was a quiet person, but her emotions started to bloom.\n\nThen today has come. August 11th.\nYuki already has become professional.\nAlso, a hoverfly started to live in the shop. (We will talk about her later.)\n\"Hey, Mentari. How are you? Did you fix the bike?\"\n\"Shut up, Yuki. Didn't you get hurt?\"\n\"I got another job. I'll call you later.\"\nEverything looked good.\n\n\"Yuki, there must be many people who want flowers for the next holiday. Let's make some bouquets in advance.\" \"Wait, you sure you wanna do this much?\" \"If there was only me, I would have to make it all on my own.\" We were making bouquets. One hour later, when our waist started to ache, Yuki's phone rang. \"Just a minute, boss.\" Yuki went outside and got the call. It was Mentari. \"What? I said I am working, Mentari.\" \"I got hit by a car.\" Yuki felt like a giant truck hit her. \"You were right... My bike was broken. I visited the garage but a car rushed to me.\" \"You idiot! Why did you try to fix it? It worked so well!\" \"You got 5th place because of the bike... You said so. Hehe.\" Mentari coughed for a while. \"Now... You can win today's racing. Don't buy another bike. But the money is...mine. I need it for surgery.\" The call had taken off. Yuki returned to the shop. She looked pale. \"Boss, May I...\" \"You can go.\" \"Sorry?\" \"If you have some work, then you should go. I'll make these bouquets.\" Yuki hesitated a bit, but soon she rushed out of the shop. Yuki got in the taxi quickly. \"Hey, be careful! Where to?\" \"To the hospital...!\" Yuki thought for a second. What does Mentari want?\n\n\"Ma'am?\" \"To the garage!\"\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\"Welcome. Are you looking for the bike?\" \"Yes...yes. where is it?\" \"Right there. Your friend paid in advance, so you can just go.\" \"Thank you.\" Riding the bike, Yuki headed to the starting point of the racing.",
