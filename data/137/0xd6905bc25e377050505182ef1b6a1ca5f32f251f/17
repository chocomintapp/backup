  "description": "\"I got a job.\" \"You call part-time jobs a job?\" Yuki and Mentari were eating ramen in the convenience store. In the last week, Yuki made a hard decision. She decided to do a part-time job until she gets AKUMA. But also in this time, that didn't always mean that everything went well. She broke a dish in the restaurant. She dropped meat in the meat buffet. She missed the calculation in the conveni. \"So, what's your job this time?\" \"Box stacking in the warehouse.\" \"Stacking what!? But you are weak as hell!\" \"Shut up. I'll do it even if I break my bone. I'll give up if the warehouse kicks me out though.\" \"Does AKUMA matter to you that much?\" \"Now you realize that you should have fixed the bike earlier.\" Yuki's phone rang. \"Time to go to work. See ya.\" Yuki headed to the warehouse. Then the supervisor told Yuki. \"Yuki, I've been thinking about it... I hope you find another job.\" This was the fourth time already.\n\nShe couldn't even start the delivery job in which she was the most confident.\nIt was because she couldn't borrow the motorbike because of her low credit level.\n\"You can still borrow the bicycle, ma'am.\"\n\"No, it's okay.\"\nHolding a small amount of salary she got in her hand, Yuki returned to her home.\n.\n.\n.\n'Boom!'\nYuki hit her head on something.\nThere was a big flower wreath when she looked up.\nThat place was my shop, Yuhwa_aab1. The big wreath was the gift I got for opening the shop. Yes, it was the first day that I opened the shop.\n\"Are you okay?\"\nI ran towards Yuki, sitting on the road.\nYuki seemed so surprised. Opening her eyes wide, she didn't say anything.\nThen she started to drop the tears that she was holding.\nYuki cried like a baby. In front of my shop.\nNo matter if people care or not, she cried loudly, and I comforted her by crawling next to her.\nThere was no customer that day.\n\n\"Do you want to work here?\" I asked Yuki.\nYuki was sitting on the sofa in my shop, and drinking a cup of coffee that I brew.\nYuki answered, \"I'd like to, but this is the flower shop. Do I suit for that?\"\n\"There's no style at flowers. It just depends on whose hands.\"\nYuki looked at me like I am a weirdo.\n\"Yuki, you said you majored in horticulture.\"\n\"I barely graduated.\"\n\"Then that's enough! I'd be glad if you work in my shop. It's minimum wage, though.\"\nYuki looked at me like I am a real weirdo.\n\"Why?\"\n\"Sorry?\"\n\"You can get better people with that money! Why me?\"\nI thought for a minute and answered,\n\"To be honest there must be many people better than Yuki.\"\n\"Yea.\"\n\"And there must be much more people better than those.\"\nI leaned my body toward her a bit and looked into her eyes.\n\"It's pointless to compare to others. It will be endless if you start to think so. If you do just as much as I want, then that's enough. It will be easier than you think.\"\n\nThere was a moment of quiet.\n\n\"What should I do?\"\n\"Chores, and Studying license of the florist. I'll pay more if you get the license.\"\nYuki looked at me for a while, then answered, \"Give me the contract.\"",
