  "description": "\"VROOM!\"\nThat night, people couldn't sleep due to the loud motorbike noise.\nThe lights shining on the road, that was where Yuki was in.\nThe chest was facing the wild wind, the right hand was tightly holding the throttle, and the head was sweating inside the helmet.\nYuki's whole body was thinking only about the rush.\nBut that didn't always mean that everything went well.\n\"Elizabeth! Achieves the crown! Come next, Indigo, Justice, Black Buzz, and Yuki!\"\nIt was 5th place.\nOn one night in June, the urban racing of town_aab1 was ending.\n\n\"When are you gonna fix your damn bike?\"\n\"I said it's you who got the 5th place, not the bike! You borrow my bike and you say shit?\"\nYuki and Mentari were talking on the pub street of town_aab1.\n\"I swear, if I had my bike I would be the first.\"\n\"That's neat. Is that your last word? Anyway, take care. I'm going, Yuki.\"\nMentari disappeared in the dark, riding her bike.\n\nYuki returned to her home at midnight.\nLights were on, and there were messy clothes around the house.\n'pitter-patter...'\nAfter taking a shower, Yuki counted the money she got from racing.\n\"1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Just 50 dollars.\"\nIt was 50 dollars. She thought it was enough until the racing next week if she only eat noodles.\nYuki turned on the video app. The recommended videos were full of motorbikes since that's the only thing she watched.\nWhen she rode a motorbike, or when she had painkillers, Yuki could concentrate on the present. There were no more painkillers, so the bike was the only escape for Yuki.\nYuki watched the short videos.\nAs much as she wanted.\n.\n.\n.\nAbout two hours later, when she was about to sleep, one video caught her mind.\nA black motorbike was slowly spinning under the violet neon light.\n'fast as the devil! Reviewing the new motorbike AKUMA'\nShe knew that it was bragging, but she couldn't turn it off.\nIt was the bike that she always dreamed of.\n\"I need my bike.\"\nYuki told to herself.",
