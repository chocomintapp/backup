  "description": "Never imagined a florist holding a cigarette.  She's my co-worker. She is cynical, but a great florist. Maybe better than me.  She doesn't care even if a hoverfly hovers around her. But she moves her cigar to not let the smoke touch the hoverfly.  Her name is Yuki. Meaning snow in Japanese.",
