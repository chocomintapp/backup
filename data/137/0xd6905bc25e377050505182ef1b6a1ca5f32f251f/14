  "description": "Small terrariums are hard to build. Especially if it's a smaller one.\n\nToday's client gave me a challenge. Giving me a small glass, she asked me to build a terrarium inside.\n\nYuki bought a lot of ingredients. Moss, stones, plants... I tried a lot, but I couldn't make a good one, so Yuki has to bring those again. She looked annoyed.\n\nAfter many tries, I was almost giving up. But then Yanghwa helped me. With her small hands, she slowly built a peaceful terrarium inside the glass.\n\nThe client looked very happy. She thanked me, but I told her that it couldn't be done without Yuki and Yanghwa. The client paid me a lot, so we had a nice dinner.",
