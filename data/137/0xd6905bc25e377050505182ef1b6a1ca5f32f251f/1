  "description": "I suddenly imagined this.\n\nIn the future, Earth is too bad to live so we all have this spheres and build our home in here.\n\nWow, that really sounds like fantasy, but reality can be worse than this.\n\nBut personally, I wish I can have house like that. Well, the glass of the surface should be bulletproof, obviously.\n\nI will be a farmer in there. Grow small amount of corns, beans, and potatoes.\n\nAnd I will love my own personal space.\n\nWait, isn’t that a greenhouse?",
