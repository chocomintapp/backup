  "description": "Today, I went to the community farm that I joined this March.\n\nWe planted melons in March, and it was already the time to harvest.\n\nOthers already harvested theirs, so there was only mine left in the farm.\n\nUsing the scissor that I brought, I cut the melon carefully. It was smaller than I saw in the market, but big enough to eat with my family.\n\nNow I put that in my home. It will be riped well after 2 or 3 days.\n\nCan't wait for it!",
