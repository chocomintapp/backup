  "description": "Loneliness can be the motivation of creating.  I used to do everything just for attention. Drawing pictures, giving gifts, playing games…  But none of them really helped, because I lost myself and people didn’t like it.  I had to face myself and acknowledge that I was not caring myself.  Now everything is okay, maybe. Sometimes I still lose myself but I trust myself that I have power to get up now.  If I feel down, I will read this post and remember that I have power.",
