It was a high-speed bomber that could hit a maximum speed of 580km/h.\n\nThe water-cooled engine, which was made in Japan, had a low operating rate. However, it performed as planned in units that were able to perform proper maintenance. A night fighter version was also developed.\n\n**艦上爆撃機 彗星 12型**  \n九九艦爆の後継とした開発された艦上爆撃機です。  \nドイツ仕込みの水冷エンジン「アツタ三二型」を搭載し、爆弾倉を開閉式にするなどシャープで近代的なシルエットを実現。最高速度580km/hを叩き出す高速爆撃機でした。\n\n水冷エンジンにつきものの稼働率の低さは課題でしたが、適切な整備を行える部隊ではスペック通りの性能を発揮し、その高速性を活かして斜銃を搭載した夜間戦闘機型（一二戊型）も開発されました。",
