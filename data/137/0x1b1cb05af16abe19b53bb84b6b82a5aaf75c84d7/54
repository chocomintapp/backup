  "description": "Created By [Clarus@Monstarz](https://twitter.com/Monstarz_bh) \n\n“Choco-banana” (Chocolate Covered Bananas) is a summertime dessert that is made by dipping a banana into melted chocolate. The chocolate banana is then covered with different toppings. \n\nThese are often sold at \"Demise\".\nAt the Japanese \"Ennichi\" or \"Matsuri\", there are rows of stalls called “Demise” you can buy your favorite food from a food stall, then enjoy it while walking around.\n“Ennichi” is a day that you connect with Gods or Buddha.\n“Matsuri” means a ritual for worshiping Gods or Buddha, or an event held in gratitude towards nature.",
