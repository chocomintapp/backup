  "description": "Let's play with MEMEs.\nConcepts define the world, and it is concept memes that make the world.\nThis is a philosophy that generates various concepts and memes.\n\nWith Doraemon homage, various words and concepts are generated in the four-dimensional pocket.\nWhile Doraemon was a Web 1-like project in which Fujiko Fujio, the author, was the owner, Very MeMe Animals is a project in which everyone creates various concepts.\nThat is why Very MeMe Animals has ears that Doraemon does not have, to listen to the voice of the holder.\nLike the world that spreads out beyond the four-dimensional pocket, the world that Very MeMe Animals gives birth to is infinite.\nVery MeMe Animals is a medium that generates an infinite number of new concepts.\nWould you like to travel through the world of NFT, which represents words that generate memes?",
