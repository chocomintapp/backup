Zashiki warashi is a small yokai that has appeared in Japanese folklore for a long time and is said to help with household chores and surprise people.\n\nIn this collection, zashiki warashi wearing monster suits represents the fusion of Japanese culture and monster culture. Japanese monster culture expresses the aesthetics and philosophy unique to Japan, and has gained many fans from all over the world. Zashiki warashi wearing monster suits expresses the fusion of Japanese culture and monster culture in this way. The traditional Japanese yokai, zashiki warashi, wears a modern and innovative design monster suit and exudes a new charm.
