  "description": "Variety: Kohaku\nSize: 63 cm \nParent: John Legend \nSpawning Date: June 2020 \nGrandson of S Legend who won a bid for 1.69 million dollars.\n\nThe number one attraction is its potential to grow bigger. Before putting it in the wild pond, it was high body and I thought it would not grow in length, but when I put it in the wild pond, it grew steadily, so this Koi grows while still being thick. Thick Koi often have a hard body, but this carp has a soft body and a strong swimming figure, so we can expect it to grow in the future. This Koi will be more than 85cm easily. The next attraction of this Koi is the \"Beni\" quality. \"Beni\" is persimmon-colored \"Tsuya Beni\", and although \"Kiwa\" is rough now, \"Beni\" is solid, so there is a high possibility that it will become beautiful in the future. It is also attractive that \"Shiroji\" is pure white and good quality skin.",
