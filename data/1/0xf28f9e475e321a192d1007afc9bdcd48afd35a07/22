  "description": "“Crypto Art Week Asia” from 9 to 17 July\nCAWA Fukuoka Japan Metaverse Exhibition 2021\n\nUpsetters® Crypto Art Gallery\nhttps://oncyber.io/upsetters45\n\nAs the first NFT digital art gallery in Fukuoka Japan, Upsetters®︎ will be participating in Crypto Art Week Asia. \nWe will post several works by artists active in Asia and those with ties to Fukuoka. \nIn addition, we will post several works by Fukuoka students. \nWe will be satisfied if the whole Asia will be excited and as many people as possible can enjoy. \nWe would like to express our respect to all the staff and participating artists.\n\n2021/6/29 04:11 am  \nThis is a creative that I would like to keep as a memorial NFT.\nThis NFT was created as a gallery decoration, but it is available for purchase if anyone wants to purchase it as a memorial (lol). \nEvery day I stay up late thinking about how I can contribute to the excitement of the event.\nTomorrow, I will contact Fukuoka City Hall and the newspaper to see if the TV station will cover the event after it is over, or if it will just disappear. \nThank you so much to all the international artists and the management team. And last but not least, give these students a look at their work! \nAlso, I am an artist working in Tokyo and the name of my collection is \"Tokyomatic20XX\", \nbut I will tell you why I am not participating in the Tokyo gallery when the time comes.\n\nThank you all so much!!!\n\nJET Upsetters®︎",
