  "description": "This is the first edition of this artwork on display at M.A.D.S.'s International Mixed Reality Art Exhibition. \n----------------- \nHozenji Koisan Dori is located in the heart of downtown Osaka. Koisan&quot; means &quot;youngest daughter. The scenery dreamed up by the tomboyish youngest daughter is a world where Osaka&#39;s retro and modern styles are combined. \nThe girl wonders whether to return to reality, which is right next door, or to continue on in the world of her dreams.",
