  "description": "The shape of the cloud in the center reminded me of the Flying Nimbus, the flying cloud that Sun Wukong rides in Journey to the West. The setting sun shining from behind the clouds strengthened the divinity of the scene, and I felt that I was in the right place.\n\nPhoto Taken: 2021/7/15\n\nSize: 6240 × 4160\n\nDusk is a phenomenon that evokes a wide range of emotions. It can bring excitement, awareness, peace, and healing. It can also evoke nostalgic feelings, such as memories of playing outside until late as a child. I have always loved watching the dusk, which evokes such a variety of emotions.\n\nThe year 2021 was a turning point in my life that inspired this collection. There was a coronavirus pandemic and a child was born at the same time. It became difficult for me to go out and travel, and I started to get busy with childcare and work. Not being able to go out meant that the only scenery I could see was the familiar scenery of my neighborhood, and the lack of sleep due to crying at night also added to the problem, and I gradually lost my curiosity and interest.\n\nIt was photography and sunsets that brought me curiosity and inspiration. One day, after a long day at work, I looked out the window of my house and was taken aback by the beauty of the sunset. I found myself unconsciously taking out my camera and taking pictures.\n\nNo two sunsets are the same, even though they are taken from the same location. The coloration and gradation, the shape and arrangement of the clouds are all different. Just a few minutes of time can make a big difference in the impression. Even though I was looking from the same place, the dusk was always free. From that point on, I was able to face each day's different dusk with the joy of discovery and curiosity, and I started to take pictures of them.\n\nFor me, dusk is a reminder of the curiosity and excitement in our ordinary, unchanging lives. The act of watching the sunset from the same place has brought me an installation that shows that beauty can be found in familiar places.",
