  "description": "Rare photograph by Hayat & Pirsky.\n2023, Polaroid Type 51 PN black and white positive- negative film sheet 4x5 inch. 104 x 81 cm\nMixed media (print on rice paper, paint)\nDandelion as an allegory of paratroopers\nA reference to the poem “September 1982” by the Israeli-Russian poet Mikhail Gendelev. \nThis poem reflects on the indifference of the Lord towards earthly matters, portraying a scene where nature and war coexist in a strange harmony. The first stanza describes the slow unfolding of nature amidst the smoke of war, with tanks moving methodically towards their destination, likened to a prayerful procession. The second stanza continues this theme, suggesting that even the simplest elements of nature, like dandelions in the wind, yearn for a higher realm. The final stanza addresses the Lord directly, questioning what dreams or visions occupy His mind while the poet fills pages with thoughts of love and immortality, contrasting with themes of destruction and death. The mention of a black and crimson butterfly symbolizes the readiness to transcend earthly confines.",
