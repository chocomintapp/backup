  "description": "This painting was done when France won the soccer World Cup in 2018. It was such an inspiring thing to see and I had to paint something\n\nMy friend Pierre, living in Hong Kong, bought the painting and checked it in with Hong Kong express airline on his way back home. When he arrived hower the painting was nowhere to be found......tracking couldn't find it\n\nSo he sued the airline, won the case, got his money back in HK court. Just by not giving up he won against bullies who think they can just by you off with \"swag\" when they are clearly in the wrong.\n\nSo I made this NFT and now I am giving it to Pierre on June 6th 2021 because even though he got his money back original paintings are irreplacable\n\nLove you homie  ",
