  "description": "Cherry blossoms have been deeply familiar to Japanese people since the Heian period (from the end of the 8th century).\nThe transient nature of cherry blossoms, which bloom in spring when the sun is abundant and fall in the blink of an eye, has often been regarded as a symbol of life and death.\n\nNami doesn't know the faces of his parents. All he remembers is the hand that was extended to him on that spring day when he was ready to die.\n\n古くは平安時代（8世紀末～）から日本人に深く親しまれている花、桜。\n陽の光溢れる春に開花し、あっという間に散ってしまう儚さは、度々「生と死の象徴」とされた。\n\n「浪」は両親の顔を知らない。覚えているのは、死を覚悟したあの春の日に、差し伸べられた手のことだけだ。",
