  "description": "“Ranji” is a trademark label affixed to boxes and packages when Japanese tea is exported overseas.\nIn order to increase the product value, artists such as ukiyo-e artists have created colorful designs that will capture the hearts of people overseas.\n\nFrom the Edo period to the Meiji period, when trade between Japan and other countries began, the main traded goods were raw silk and tea. Initially, Japanese tea was exported from Yokohama Port, but as the export window gradually moved to Shimizu Port, the number of tea farmers and tea merchants increased, and Fujieda developed as a town of the tea industry.\n\nTea is the spirit and culture of Japan.\nFujieda is a place where many people from Japan and abroad come and go, overflowing with tea merchants.\n\nWe are entering a new era of WEB3.0.\nWhile exploring how tea and Fujieda should be in the modern world, we would like to increase the number of members who can sympathize with us by utilizing the means of WEB 3.0 that connects the world in common.\n\nFujieda, which used to be a trading base, will challenge FUJIEDA in the future.",
