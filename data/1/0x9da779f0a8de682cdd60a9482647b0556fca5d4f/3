  "description": "Echeveria\n\nThis season brings back fond memories. The echeverias  my grandfather had carefully nurtured over the years spread out to encompass the concrete wall separating the house from the street. My grandfather was a warm and meticulous man with a passion for gardening and coin collecting. And this South American native succulent, Echeveria, grows best in the warm spring.\n\n\nThe girl surrounded by such spring light and lush echeverias.\nI expresses the beauty and transience of the changing seasons and her feelings for her late grandfather. Her translucent skin reminds one of the fresh spring breeze, and the lush echeveria reminds one of the warmth of her grandfather's love. Furthermore, the light shining from right to left represents opposites: life and death.\nThe right side symbolizes life, while the left side symbolizes death.\n\nThe unfinished white tattoo on the girl's back represents hope for a future yet to be seen. I painted this picture in the hope that those who walk through life with this picture will also have a bright future.\n\nâ€»Please note that there is a possibility of secondary use such as merchandising.",
