  "description": "The techniques of the traditional works will be recorded and preserved in the NFT. All pieces will be 1/1 and there will be 10 pieces made in the entire series.\n\nThe first purchaser will be sent the actual piece. (Overseas, of course). The NFTs will be issued on the ETH chain, and the animations will be stored in IPFS.\n\nBuddhist metal crafts created between 1950 and 1990 found dormant in the warehouse were chemically treated to regenerate them as the WABI-SABI Pot. This creates a collaboration between “past” and “present” craftspeople.",
