  "description": "In 2008 I started my art trading with postcard size images of stuff that happens around me and things I think about.\n\nIn 2022 I am starting the \"only for trade\" NFT collection. These are the images of the postcard size paintings which I still barter for with whomever I meet.\n\nThese are not for sale, only for trade 1 to 1 with art in your wallet.",
