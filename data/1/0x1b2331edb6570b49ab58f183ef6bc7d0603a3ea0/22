  "description": "A record of the days spent in Tokyo under the Corona disaster in the summer of 2021. Used a camera that does not allow for detailed settings. A red filter was attached, and the film was developed using an unregulated developing solution. Attempting to get an unpredictable image.\n\nBy Burn the NFTed photo, the original negative film can be obtained. When the photo is burned (memory erased), it remains in the hands of the user as a material (bone). In exchange for the material, lose a life. Or can we say that the death of the body, or the existence of an imaginary being, or even something that does not exist in this world, but is in someoneâ€™s memory, means the life of that being? The international convention was elusive, and for what purpose was it a festival?\n\nMemories and questions of the events of one summer.\n\nComposed of 58 photographs.  \nPublished under ERC721.",
