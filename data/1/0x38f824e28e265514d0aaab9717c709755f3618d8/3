Initially, we expected that the paint would become spherical. But contrary to expectations, the Zero Gravity Sound of Ikebana has shapes that resemble the Sound of Ikebana under normal gravity but has a more straightforward and more beautiful form.\n\n---\n\nSuccessful bidders who attend the afterparty for the Zero Gravity exhibition in person will be eligible to receive an exclusive gift.
