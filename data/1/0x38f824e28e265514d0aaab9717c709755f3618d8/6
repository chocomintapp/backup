  "description": "These video artworks were created by shooting flowers frozen in liquid nitrogen with an air gun and letting the flowers scatter. As this phenomenon does not occur naturally, it gives the impression that it happens at a mysterious place somewhere in the universe. These artworks were created based on this impression and are reminiscent of a mysterious flower garden in the weightless universe.\n\n---\n\nSuccessful bidders who attend the afterparty for the Zero Gravity exhibition in person will be eligible to receive an exclusive gift.
