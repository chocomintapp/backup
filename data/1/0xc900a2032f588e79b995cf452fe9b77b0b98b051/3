  "description": "Although economic activities in the world have been suppressed due to the corona disaster, the world is on the way to recovery mainly in developed countries due to COVID-19 vaccination and economic measures. \n\nHowever, the recovery of the world is still unpredictable. In such a situation, Our label of \"CODONA\" released new tracks by me on November 24, hoping that the world will recover and the dance floor will return to its frenzy.\n\nThe concept of the track is based on the idea of a hidden sushi restaurant in a time when fish are extinct and sushi is illegal.\nIt's about a decadent world of the future, a world like Blade Runner. If there were a sushi restaurant there, what kind of music would be played there? Just imagine it.\n\nMy answer to this question is this track.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/K7Y-FT5hNCY\n\n*** Important ***  \nOwners of the NFT could ask me where to find the file of this high quality version of the track.\nThe owner should give me the wallet address from the social network account linked to your NFTs marketplace account.\nI'll send you a link to the file in high quality sound.\n\nThe WAV file is easy to copy, so you can simply buy it just to get this and then sell it off immediatelyðŸ˜†\n\n## NFT terms\n\nOnly to receive the high quality recording music data of the NFT and resale rights in NFT are granted, and you have no right to license, commercially exploit, reproduce, distribute,  or the music or artwork contained therein.
