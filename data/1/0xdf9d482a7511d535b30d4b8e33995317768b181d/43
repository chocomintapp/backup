  "description": "3D artwork by SOTA IKEDA. The children are impressive with their angry or sad eyes and non-existent mouths. The HUMLEOs, born out of hatred for the coronavirus, were modeled after humans and animals. However, because people were all wearing masks at the time, false information was put into their genes, such as the fact that humans do not have mouths. This is the reason why HUMLEOs do not have mouths.",
