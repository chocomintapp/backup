  "description": "The electronic beeps that periodically sound in a dark, windowless room...  \nShe never rests, just collects.  \n  \n\"Almost there... almost there... almost there... finally here...\"  \n  \nThere were no tears falling, but the time she had been waiting for was approaching, so close that even the emotions that had faded before seemed to be overflowing...  \n  \nA creak on the floor... the door to the room opens and a figure appears.  \n  \n\"...... Don't be alarmed, I'm the same, I'm the one who was Deprived of existence...\"  \n  \n暗く窓のない部屋で定期的に鳴る電子音…  \n彼女は、休む事も無くただ収集をしている  \n  \n「もう少し…あと少しで渡せる…やっとここまで来た…」  \n  \n落ちる涙はないが、以前より薄れた感情すら溢れそうなほど、待ち望んだその時が近づいていた…  \n  \n床のきしむ音…部屋の扉が開き、人影が見える  \n  \n「……警戒しなくてもいいのよ、私も同じ、奪われた者だから…」",
