  "description": "This is my art work with Japanese brush. Japanese Zen style.\nZen Eye - The state of dhyāna, samādhi.\n\nZen is another name for the mind.\nIt is the absence of a single phase. It is a state of mind that does not dwell in one place. It is the mind of the Buddha.\n\nEven though our mind is a pure \"Buddha,\" it is clouded by our egoistic desire to protect our own convenience and position by differentiating ourselves from other beings, objectifying them, and creating distance and boundaries.\n\nThe world is not as we wish it to be, but to be precise, it is not as we desire it to be. The \"will\" in \"nyoi\" does not refer to egoism, but to the mind of the Buddha, which transcends the boundaries and distances between self and others, and is common to all things.\n\nThe workings of the mind of the Buddha include wisdom and compassion, which can also be referred to as forgiveness. It is a generous mind that forgives and recognizes those who are different from us and unites them with us, based on the empty values of \"immortality, purity, and non-increase and non-decrease.\n\nTo transcend the distance and boundaries between oneself and others, one must make oneself empty.\nZen is the kind of free and unrestricted mind that can be unobstructed by the chirping of sparrows or the fragrance of flowers.\n",
