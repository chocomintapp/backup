  "description": "This is ver 1.0 of my robot series and has a total of 3 robots\n\nI am a big fan of all things robot including movies, books as well as just good old industrial bots.\n\nIsaac Asimov's laws of robotics as well as newer fiction such as Chappie by Neill Blomkamp are just two of the places I have taken inspiraton for this series\n\nI also tend to call myself Krs Bot when I want to remove emotion from decision making and/or I am just tired of human interaction and want to be left alone.\n\nThe ver three ver 1.0 robots were originally sold together with the canvases I painted in 2021 on this theme. \n\nNothing but love\nKrs",
