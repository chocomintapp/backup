  "description": "Before we set out on our amazing road trip I went to the art store to pick up a few more canvases. Initially I had thought to bring my easel with me and paint at different locations but I ended up just sketching instead which was just as well all things considered. What I did do was to decide that I wanted to have a different palette from the first three paintings but that I wanted to stay with Salvadorenian colours. The brown represents the coffee that the country is so famous for and of course the blue of the flag. \n\nThis first painting depicts the road trip we took to Coatepeque lake and La Zonte beach. You can see the lake three times as we looked at it from different angles and dived into it from the springboards of our hotel. At the bottom you can see waves crashing over the beach where we met Peche and Chuca, one of the worlds best stand up boogie boarders. It is a painting full of movement and represents well the journey we took together. The flowers in the background carry the DNA of the new country that I have had the privilege to visit \n\nAcylic on Canvas\n70 x 60 cm",
