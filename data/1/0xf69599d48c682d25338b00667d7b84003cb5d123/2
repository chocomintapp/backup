  "description": "It depicts El Salvador both in the colours of the arch, which are the same as the flag, as well in the idea of ‚ÄúCorn People‚Äù who, when viewed  from straight on, looks exactly like two rabbits.\n\nAre they being put together or pulled apart? \nWhy does one look happier than the other?\n\nSharks in the ocean which is slightly polluted but is why Kero is filling in as a sewage cleaning plant so all will be ok. This probably comes from the fact that I am in charge of toilet cleaning in our room üòÇ\n\nThe left side is dark and full of outdated dark code which is being purged while the future is looking bright indeed. \n\nThe brushwork on this piece is some of the finest I have ever done.\n\nAcrylic on canvas\n70x60 cm",
