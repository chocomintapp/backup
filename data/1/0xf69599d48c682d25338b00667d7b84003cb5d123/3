  "description": "It’s a conundrum when not only your tongue but also your head is split in two directions. The “duality in all things” has always been a topic that interests me deeply. In this case it is a dragon covered in leaves which is divided in two directions \n\nOn the one hand you have the large city of San Salvador and the slightly worried dragon looking down on the city of San Salvador. This is the arm that carries the coffee and the country on its back.\n\nOn the other hand you have a fierce dragon who is not only building strength and teeth facing outward with intention. El Salvador is a country filled with tremendous talent and these people are starting to reach out beyond borders to create and work with a new digital economy that knows no borders or time zones. Neither does it need offices or desks or free snacks. This is an interesting time in the rebuilding of this beautiful country and I am happy to be here to witness it.\n\nThe painting is a natural continuation of the theme and style that was used in “rabbit corn” and they should be considered a pair. I don’t recommend splitting them apart.\n\nThe city has reached the oceans and the volcano fires it’s rage and releases it out into the night to mix with scents of grilled meat, Pupusa and Cumbia beats of San Salvador night time.\n\nWhile it might seem at the bottom right that we are in “Dire Straits'' there is still a small opening and it’s all about finding that hole and gnawing at it until it becomes big enough for everyone to peek through. To poke our heads through and say to the other side, Here we are\n\nAcrylic on canvas\n70 x 60 cm ",
