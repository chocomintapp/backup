  "description": "The stages of love is an ode to love itself. It shows the beauty of love from the beginning as infatuation and attraction and then deepening towards a darker firmer deep red love. Love itself is a balloon of air rising in the pink sky of the blood red city.\n\nWith these two paintings I knew what I wanted to paint and therefore my focus could be on execution and in this particular case I worked a lot on the background and the contrasts between the colours. It is a simple yet strong message, exactly the way I wanted it\n\nAcrylic on canvas\n70 x 60 cm",
