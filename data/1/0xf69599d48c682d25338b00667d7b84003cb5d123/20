  "description": "On the first night when I arrived at La Resi in San Salvador Timo and Andre sat me down, gave me beer, or was it two…, and started explaining about the very rich cultural heritage of El Salvador. I must confess that after 24 hours of travelling and with the wheat and barley of a 750ml Regia (they don’t come in small sizes) sloshing around my empty belly I don’t remember it all.\n\nBut I do remember El Cadejo. Partly because they are wolves but more so because of what they seem to represent. Good and Evil are inherent concepts in the human psyche that we all wrestle with and in the form of El Cadejo they take this particular shape. It is said that they appear only at night and in the middle of the mountains to weary travellers. The Black Cadejo represents darkness and the devil and when it hunts it’s eyes turn from blue to red. The White Cadejo on the other hand is the protector and aims to shield humans from harm and danger.  \n\nWhy does the human mind have both sides?\nReading the legend of El Cadejo, it seems as though darkness and mischief will only lead us to pain, harm and death while light will save us. So why do we have the dark side then?\n\nBecause I don’t think any of us can deny that every angel has a dark little friend…. \n",
