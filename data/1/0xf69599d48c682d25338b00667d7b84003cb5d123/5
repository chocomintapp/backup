  "description": "The second painting with this palette and style is most likely me jumping with joy after all the great adventures we had. On this painting I did some interesting work with depth as I painted the face as a helmet, or some sort of metallic material which changes the focus of the eyes from the background to the foreground and then all over again.\n\nYou can see binary code in the back pattern and the lack of 0s mean that there werenâ€™t many negative patterns along the way.\n\nAcrylic on canvas",
