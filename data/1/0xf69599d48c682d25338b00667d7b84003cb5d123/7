  "description": "The opposite of love is not loss and separation. Separation, if we let it, might tear us apart and leave nothing but a memory. We compartmentalise and rationalise and hide away the painful memories deep in our memory banks where it can no longer hurt us. By doing this the burdens of our sadness lightens and as time goes by what may feel as a physical, open wound, slowly scabs over letting us fall into the bliss of forgetting. This allows us to move on with our lives and to keep going.\n\nThe opposite of love is fear. When we fear love becomes a ship lost at sea, never to be found again. Searching for love is hopeless when fear stands in the way since even if we found it we would not recognize it. Fear blinds us from love and focuses us on survival. To be capable of love, and thus ironically opening ourselves up to loss, we have to drive fear from our hearts and societies.\n\n“Yeah though I walk through the valley of death I shall fear no evil”\n\nFor I have love in my heart and only with love shall we prevail.\n\nAcrylic on canvas\n70 x 60 cm",
