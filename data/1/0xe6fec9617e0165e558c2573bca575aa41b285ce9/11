  "description": "We officially open the first and best Virtual NFT museum, entirely on IPFS.\n\nAll this NFT sale will go to Virtual Museum by Saru to build better experience for all artists and art lovers in the world.\n\nAlso, The first this NFT holder can make one custom made gallery in the museum for 1month!\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nHi I’m Saru, making virtual NFT museum on IPFS by my selves from scratch includes 3D assets.\n\nI want to make the place for all NFT artists to share their arts easily for FREE, and the place for any people to explore and enjoy arts from all over the world.\n\nSo firstly I wanna make this museum bigger and better experience in one place n never close on IPFS which I just made. But same time, I feel we should have more fun event or function in museum too.\n\nSecond, I'm happy to make gallery for others too. But the problem is I'm making entire museum by my selves for 3D model, Coding, (only music is from my friend.). Also I use my night and weekend time to build so I might need to build up team for that in the future.\n\nFinally, for big metaverse. That is my dream, but I think If I make both spaces above (My museum and each other museums), I can transfer the player between museum and galleries. so that I can make \"huge\" museum same time.\n\nHere is the museum link\nhttps://museum.on.fleek.co/\nOR\nmuseum.saru.eth/\n",
