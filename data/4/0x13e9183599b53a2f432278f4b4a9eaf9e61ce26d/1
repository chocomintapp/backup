You scared me, you made me hate my body at a young age, you scarred my subconscious that created some violence in my future, i felt like i wasn't loved and wanted. it created such neediness in love in my adulthood, how long did i hate people because i was thinking they are all hurt? how long it was affecting me from so within into the surface of my reality? You hurt me but i forgive you, you were scarred too, you lost it, i know it's not your fault. I am sorry that it didn't work out for you in some other way. I am sorry we have left you.\n\nI'm grateful for you and for that scar, I'm grateful for you to have come into my room that night and stub me, it made me so unique, so strong, so powerful. I am a survivor of your violence at my two years olf of life, I am a survivor of a knife gliding right next to my heart and rip of thru my back. I'm a miracle, and it is my destiny to be, to see the full-fledged bad where I had to find the good. And look at me today, I am confident, I am the warrior of love, I am a character, I am unique, I am powerful and empowering, I am who I am. I healed, and so is my bloodline so are you. So thank you, my offender, my Grandmother, for that you have imprinted change into my DNA and I am the changer thanks to you.\n\nP.s I'm sorry, I love you, please forgive me, I am grateful for you.  \n\n\nMessage to the reader: \n The one coin always has two sides, if a bad side happened to you, look for the good in it, find what to be grateful for as when you grateful, you are powerful and you won't lose it ...",
