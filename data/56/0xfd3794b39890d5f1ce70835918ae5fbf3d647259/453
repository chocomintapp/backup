  "description": "The painting \"Girl with the Pearl Earring\", painted by the Dutchman Johannes Vermeer, in 1665, may well represent a young woman in an everyday moment, in the midst of her household chores, with a blue scarf on her head and a pearl earring, which becomes the focal point of the painting.\nAn easily recognized work, which arouses our curiosity to discover it, is one of our tributes, in NFT, to the world of the arts.\n",
