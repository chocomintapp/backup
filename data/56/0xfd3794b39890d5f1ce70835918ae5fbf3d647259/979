  "description": "With the title Abaporu, which means \"aba\" and \"poru\" - \"man who eats\", in Tupi-Guarani, Tarsila do Amaral's painting, dated 1928, is the most valuable painting in Brazilian art.\nWe chose this NFT to close our collection because it is a notorious work of art, in many ways: the artist, his relationships, his historical moment and above all for translating the feeling of Brazilianness.\n",
