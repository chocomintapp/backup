  "description": "When Edvard Munch painted The Scream in 1893, he didn't make any representations of joy, he only showed deep anguish and immense despair.\nOur NFT has strong colors, as he used to do, but of course without all the details of the original work, as we tried to represent the author's feelings with a slightly happier view of the spectators.\n",
